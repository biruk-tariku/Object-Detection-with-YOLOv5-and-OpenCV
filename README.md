# Object Detection with YOLOv5 and OpenCV

This project demonstrates object detection using YOLOv5 with the Ultralytics library and OpenCV. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. We'll use a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect objects in images or videos.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Ultralytics (`ultralytics`)
- `cars.mp4` (or any video file you want to use for object detection)
- Pre-trained YOLOv5 weights (`yolov8n.pt`) - Download from [YOLOv5 Releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    cd your_repository
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 weights (`yolov8n.pt`) from [YOLOv5 Releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) and place them in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open `object_detection.py` in your favorite text editor.
2. Uncomment lines 9-11 to use a webcam for real-time object detection. Or, keep line 13 uncommented to use a video file (replace `"cars.mp4"` with your video file).
3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python object_detection.py
    ```

4. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the script.

## Results

The script will display the video feed with bounding boxes and labels drawn around detected objects. The confidence score for each detection will also be displayed.

## Customization

- You can customize the list of classes by modifying the `classNames` variable in the script.
- Adjust the detection threshold and other parameters in the YOLOv5 model initialization (`model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")`) according to your needs.
